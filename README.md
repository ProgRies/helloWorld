# helloWorld
Testing Repository

This is a test Project, done with the HelloWorld guide.

I'll use this Repository to dump in any hello world files I create from now on. I usually create one whenever I get set up in a new enviroment or new language, so this might be a nice way to keep track of where and with what I code!
